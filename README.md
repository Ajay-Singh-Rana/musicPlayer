# musicPlayer
A basic music player based on the one by @attreyabhatt.
It has the following features -
 i) Play and pause button switch accordingly with the state of music whether it is being played or not
 ii) An stop button (which i do not like)
 iii) Dark theme (based on my understanding of dark themes)
 iv) status bar
 v) volume scale
Features to be added :
 i) seek button for managing audio progress
 ii) suypport for all formats
 
 Currently it is using pygame module's music class to play audio files but it has a problem in playing a few files.
